This repository contains script to create a phylogenetic tree and colour the tips based on the traits of the taxa. This script is used to create the trees provided in Majoros & Adamowicz (2023) (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.15.532812v3). The original Canada dataset is too large to upload to GitHub but can be provided upon request. A sampled down version of the data containing both Canada and Greenland is provided and can be loaded in at the step specified within the code. 
This repository also contains the dataset outlined in the manuscript and a detailed README is provided.
