# Diptera_Dataset_Phylogenetic_Tree

This repository contains code outlining how to create the tree figures included in Majoros & Adamowicz (2023). This code creates a maximum likelihood tree using Diptera CO1 sequences from the Barcode of Life Data System. The tree tips are then coloured using the biological traits of the species.
