# Diptera_Dataset_Phylogenetic_Tree

This repository contains code outlining how to create the tree figures included in Majoros & Adamowicz (2023). This code creates a maximum likelihood tree using Diptera CO1 sequences from the Barcode of Life Data System. The tree tips are then coloured using the biological traits of the species. The data needed to run the analysis is provided, except for the Canada dataset. This file is too large to share to Github even when compressed, but please reach out if you would like to access this file.
